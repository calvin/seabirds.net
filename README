=== Dragonfly website files ===

The dragonfly website, www.dragonfly.co.nz, is a django application.

== Running a development instance ==

Don't change any of the settings in the dragonfly/settings.py.
If you add a file dragonfly/sitesettings.py you can override any of the settings
in the settings file that appropriate to your development site.

BTW, I have created a symlink /home/dragonflyweb ->
/home/finlay/dragonfly/dragonflyweb that allows all the paths to work as they do
on martin.

 # ln -s /home/finlay/dragonfly/dragonflyweb /home/dragonflyweb 

There are a couple of useful scripts too, for getting the database and media files:
 # ./get_media_from_martin.sh
 # ./get_database_from_martin.sh

The first one rsyncs the martin media files accross, the second takes a pg_dump
from the martin and overwrites the database on localhost.
